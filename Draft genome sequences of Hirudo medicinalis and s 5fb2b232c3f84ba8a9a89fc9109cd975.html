Like other hematophagous species, blood-sucking leeches, belonging to the subclass Hirudinea (true leeches) of the phylum Annelida, attract interest in regard to the identification of novel bioactive compounds. Blood-sucking leeches and, in particular, medicinal leeches, have been used for bloodletting to treat diverse ailments since ancient times [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">6</a>]. Although there is a high risk of an undesired outcome when live leeches are applied to treat human diseases, hirudotherapy is still indicated in certain medical conditions. In particular, application of medicinal leeches improves tissue drainage after replantation when the common surgical correction of venous congestion fails or is unfeasible [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">7</a>]. In these cases, hirudotherapy frequently provides beneficial effects because the leech feeding apparatus has evolved to promote the finely tuned inhibition of haemostasis and blood coagulation [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">8</a>, <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">9</a>]. The composition of leech saliva has been shown to play a key role in this inhibition [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">9</a>, <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">10</a>].</p><p id="fca73218-f25a-43d8-8971-7fdcb448d2d6" class="">In medicinal leeches, which belong to the group of so-called jawed leeches, saliva is secreted by unicellular salivary glands that reside in the anterior part of the body and are interspersed between the muscle fibres that connect the jaws with the body wall. Each salivary cell extends a single duct from the cell body to the jaw, and the duct ends in a tiny opening between the calcified teeth of the jaw. Medicinal leeches incise the host skin at the feeding site by their jaws and release the salivary cell secretion (SCS) into the wound [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">9</a>]. During one act of blood meal, medicinal leeches partially or completely empty their salivary gland cells [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">11</a>]. Salivary gland cells have been shown to replenish their reservoirs with the content of SCS within 7 days after blood meal [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">12</a>]. In addition to its known inhibitory effect on haemostasis and blood coagulation, SCS suppresses inflammation, exhibits analgesic effects, possesses antimicrobial activity, and alters vasodilatory responses, enhancing local blood circulation to facilitate leech feeding. Moreover, some SCS components are thought to preserve the blood from rapid degradation after ingestion.</p><p id="b6887f5f-ac49-4261-a1d0-497fb60508b3" class="">Although transcriptional analysis of the salivary glands of jawless and jawed leeches was attempted [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">13</a>,<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">14</a>,<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">15</a>,<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">16</a>] and some SCS components have been characterized and their respective targets in hosts have been identified [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">9</a>], the repertoire of the bioactive saliva components remains largely unknown. Elucidating the SCS composition in medicinal leeches is the key to understanding (i) the molecular mechanisms underlying the orchestrated interaction between the leech SCS and the components of haemostasis, (ii) evolution of the blood feeding lifestyle in leeches, and (iii) genetics of hematophagy. Identification of the unknown bioactive SCS components will facilitate the development of novel pharmacological compounds for treating impaired peripheral blood circulation, venous congestion or microbial infections.</p><p id="b984ef91-d741-4120-89b6-a4ca5f21f420" class="">In the current study, we performed sequencing, genome assembly and annotation of the H. medicinalis genome as well as transcriptional profiling of the salivary cells followed by proteomic validation of SCSs of three medicinal leeches, Hirudo medicinalis, Hirudo orientalis, and Hirudo verbana.

However, we also detected novel salivary proteins, the roles and importance of which in blood feeding have yet to be established such as F5/8 type C domain, LDLR, PAN domain as well as proteins containing vWFD and vWFA domains. Moreover, we also found, somewhat surprisingly, that genes encoding well-characterised components of the medicinal leech SCS, such as hirudin, bdellins, eglins, saratins and destabilases were not differentially expressed in the salivary cells, suggesting that the proteins encoded by these genes support not only blood feeding but also some unknown functions in the leech.</p><p id="a3c212f4-8cdd-46b4-94d4-079576641346" class="">We also identified new homologs of genes encoding known anticoagulants including antistasins and LAPP but also other blood meal-related proteins such as bdellins A and B3, eglin-C, hirustasin, destabilase, earatin/LAPP and leech DTI in the annotated genome. Interestingly, some of these genes are localized in common scaffolds and form tandems or clusters. This arrangement and the similarity of the genes suggest recent local duplications and many of them as likely to be genus Hirudo specific. This unique diversity of anticoagulatant genes highlights their specific functional significance for the leech, which has led to their positive selection with subsequent expansion in the genome. It is also notable that almost all of these genes are serine protease inhibitors such as the antistasins, serpins, Kazal-Type Serine Protease Inhibitor, Potato inhibitor I family and hirudins. All of the above protein families are involved in host hemostasis or blood digestion [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">9</a>, <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">83</a>]. They are also the most broadly represented and diverse families in the salivary secretion of leeches (Supplementary Tables <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">10</a>,<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">11</a>,<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">13</a>).</p><p id="e889b85d-b589-4afc-988d-05405bbef9f3" class="">It is possible that the initially duplication of some of these genes could be associated with dosage effects related to the amount of the gene product. During the divergence process, it is likely that some of these genes acquired increased specificity for new targets from the blood of various hosts. In the transcriptome data, we found that in most families of anticoagulants and products of blood meal related genes, the only one variant of the gene is expressed and these were the previously known sequences from the NCBI. At the same time, we also identified the expression of several variants of Bdellin B3, Lectin C-type, Destabilase, and three Elastase inhibitor genes (serpins). Gene duplication combined with positive selection is an important mechanism for the creation of new functional role for the existing genes (neofunctionalization) [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">86</a>]. The functional segregation of hirudin and hirudin-like factor genes could be an example of this. The functions of hirudin are well understood, while targets of hirudin-like factors are still not known [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">87</a>, <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">88</a>]. Moreover, the results show that many well known blood meal-related genes are found in single-copies (without duplication) including Saratin, Leech DTI and Carboxy peptidase inhibitor. These gene families have probably very conserved functional activities in blood processing during feeding and we see no signs of duplication within these gene families.</p><p id="97941f9c-5a9a-4cf8-9791-b8d7b7c348ce" class="">For a long time, thrombin and factor Xa have been thought to be the main targets of components of the leech SCS. However, similar to those of other haematophagous species, the SCS of medicinal leeches were found to contain a complex mixture of molecules that inhibit both secondary and primary hemostasis. Our findings lead to the suggestion that the action of the SCS components not merely on the key coagulation factors (thrombin and factor Xa) but on the different stages of haemostasis provides synergistic effects. Furthermore, analysis of the identified proteins demonstrated that leeches utilize ancient, highly conserved molecules as versatile affectors of the host haemostasis and immunity.</p><p id="b2798ba5-9897-44e7-bd9e-e7b9f3137a1f" class="">Similarity of the SCS compositions in the examined leeches with those of many other blood feeding species favours hypotheses about a convergent evolution of the saliva composition in evolutionary distant hematophagous animals as a result of having to adapt to the same targets in their hosts.</p><p id="638e5216-7d21-4372-aea1-6a6c330b3fb8" class="">In the proteome of the SCSs, we found proteins that usually exhibit cytoplasmic or membrane localization, such as calreticulin, calmodulin, thioredoxin, chaperones, tetraspanin transcription factors, and certain ribosomal and cytoskeletal proteins.

These proteins are relatively conserved, and exhibit shared structural and functional features among various species.

Salivary cells and muscles were isolated directly into RNeasy extraction solution for the subsequent extraction of total RNA, and the parts of the digestive tract were isolated directly into ATL buffer from the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit for the subsequent extraction of total DNA.</p><h3 id="a0a087c3-3b87-4a16-991d-b6833d6869ed" class="">cDNA library construction and sequencing</h3><p id="08484457-fed0-4208-bca2-2f88aa7e65d0" class="">Total RNA was extracted from the tissue fragments isolated by laser microdissection using an ExtractRNA Kit (Evrogen, Russia) (for details, see <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">Supplementary Methods</a>). Tissue-specific cDNA libraries were created using the Mint-2 cDNA Synthesis Kit (Evrogen, Russia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The adapters PlugOligo-3 M and CDS-4 M were used for cDNA synthesis. The normalization of cDNA was performed using the DNS (duplex-specific nuclease) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol (Evrogen, Russia). Normalized and non-normalized cDNA libraries (100 ng of each sample) were fragmented to a mean size of 400–500 bp by using a Covaris S220 System (Covaris, Woburn, Massachusetts, USA). Then, an Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies) was employed to prepare barcoded shotgun libraries. To conduct emulsion PCR, an Ion PGM Template OT2 400 Kit (Life Technologies) was utilized.

Local BLAST (BlastX threshold value of e = 1 × 10− 6, matrix BLOSUM-62) and the nr database were used for the grouping and annotation of contigs. MEGAN6 software [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">92</a>] was used to visualize the contig distribution (by KOG/EGGNOG classifications).

Because biological replicates were available only for H. verbana, we applied the dispersion estimates for H. verbana to other leech species. Genes with q-value (FDR) &lt; 0.05 were defined as differentially expressed. To perform differential expression analysis using a genome model, the cDNA reads of H. medicinalis were mapped against the genome assembly using the STAR software [<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-6748-0">98</a>].

The tube was filled with saline solution containing 10 mM arginine. A leech bit through the membrane, sucked up the salt solution and emitted its secretion into the saline solution. The saline solution enriched with SCS was continuously stirred and renewed to prevent its ingestion by leech. We collected approximately 10 mL of saline solution containing highly diluted leech SCS. Harvested SCSs were concentrated on a solid-phase extraction Sep-Pak Vac C18 6 cc cartridge (Waters, USA) using 0.1% TFA in 70%/30% acetonitrile/water (v/v) as the buffer for elution of the protein fraction.
