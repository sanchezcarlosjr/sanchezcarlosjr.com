leech has been used for medicinal purposes for millennia, and continues to be used today in modern hospital settings. Its utility is granted by the extremely potent anticoagulation factors that the leech secretes into the incision wound during feeding and, although a handful of studies have targeted certain anticoagulants, the full range of anticoagulation factors expressed by this species remains unknown. Here, we present the first draft genome of the European medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, and estimate that we have sequenced between 79–94% of the full genome. Leveraging these data, we searched for anticoagulation factors across the genome of H. medicinalis. Following orthology determination through a series of BLAST searches, as well as phylogenetic analyses, we estimate that fully 15 different known anticoagulation factors are utilized by the species, and that 17 other proteins that have been linked to antihemostasis are also present in the genome. We underscore the utility of the draft genome for comparative studies of leeches and discuss our results in an evolutionary context.</p><h2 id="09b88530-9e92-40c4-83c1-2cc64699b8cc" class="">Introduction</h2><p id="992e3e9d-631b-4a70-82b8-bd76c43964e1" class="">Notwithstanding the significance of the European medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis Linnaeus, 1758 as a medical tool from antiquity through modern science-based medicine, it is remarkable that this species’ repertoire of anticoagulants and other bioactive salivary proteins has escaped published in-depth investigation (but see<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">1</a>). In order to maintain blood flow in the tissues surrounding the incision wounds during their extended periods of feeding and, importantly, keeping the blood from clotting inside of the crop during the periods of digestion, bloodfeeding leeches secrete a variety of bioactive compounds from their salivary glands. Over 20 different compounds relating to antihemsotasis have been isolated from leech saliva including, for example, direct thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, trypsin inhibitors, endoglucuronidases and antiplatelet proteins<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">2</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">3</a>. Despite its historical significance in medicine, the detailed composition of the anticoagulant profile of Hirudo medicinalis Linnaeus, 1758 has escaped scrutiny insofar as modern studies have been concerned primarily with the commercially available species Hirudo verbana (Carena, 1820)<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">4</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">5</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">6</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">7</a>; but see also<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">1</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">8</a>. Whereas H. medicinalis was long thought to be the centerpiece for the clinical application of leeches in hospital settings, recent investigations have shown that Hirudo verbana is far more commonly employed for this purpose<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">4</a> yet sold under the name H. medicinalis; this confusion also prompted the designation of a neotype specimen for H. medicinalis in order to ameliorate future taxonomic confusion<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">9</a>. The utility of leeches in modern medicine focuses on post-surgical procedures, chiefly following digit replantation or skin grafting surgery<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">10</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">11</a> wherein the build-up of blood in the extremities and resulting congestion of the veins is relieved by their application. By contrast, medieval medicinal practices, the pinnacle of leech-centric phlebotomy, focused on restoring the balance between bodily humors to treat or prevent a variety of conditions<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">12</a>. The exceedingly frequent use of leeches caused overharvesting of several species, including Hirudo medicinalis<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">13</a>. Indeed, such was the level of harvesting in the 18th and 19th centuries that the collection of both H. medicinalis and H. verbana are still protected and governed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) (see<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">14</a> for an in-depth treatise of the species).</p><p id="ebc484aa-49f7-408f-be6c-f2c4f84e5e13" class="">Exploring the diversity of anticoagulant-related proteins and framing these in an evolutionary context in terms of presence or absence of orthologues across the phylogeny of leeches would help evince the general evolution of these proteins. Members of several leech families have been investigated at the transcriptome level for compositions of the anticoagulant repertoires, including members of Piscicolidae, Glossiphoniidae, Macrobdellidae, Haemadipsidae, Praobdellidae and Hirudinidae<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">3</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">8</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">15</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">16</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">17</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">18</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">19</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">20</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">21</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">22</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">23</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">24</a>. Genome-level evaluations within a species like H. medicinalis would allow insights into the diversity of bioactive proteins available. Exploring the copy number of anticoagulant proteins across a draft genome would also provide comparative data for future studies on putative duplication events, co-option of genes, and alternative splicing events. Beyond this, our draft genome should, when coupled with that of the non-bloodfeeding glossiphoniid Helobdella robusta (Shankland, Bissen &amp; Weisblat, 1992) (see<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">25</a>), aid a larger diversity of studies into leech evolution and allow for comparative analyses between leeches at the genome level.</p><h2 id="83531355-54eb-469a-8b94-72cd83dbcaaf" class="">Results</h2><h3 id="9744fa84-1af2-46a8-a929-88f7d9351395" class="">Assembly statistics and BUSCO analysis</h3><p id="e00f96a9-a5a9-4178-b1aa-7c604f98f11c" class="">The draft genome of Hirudo medicinalis ROMIZI 11733 was assembled to 19,929 scaffolds spanning 176.96 Mbps with a median coverage of 146.78×, an N50 score of 50,382 bps, and an L50 score of 772 (full statistics for the draft genome assembly can be found in Supplementary File 1).

High-throughout sequencing employing the 10X Chromium platform allowed us to sequence the genome to an estimated 79–94% completion and evinced 18 separate anticoagulant-related orthologues (or putative orthologues) with BLAST matches against eglin C, destabilase I, ghilanten, leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (LDTI), guamerin, cystatin, hirudin, ficolin, Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors (serpins), C-type lectin, manillase, bdellin, piguamerin, antistasin, bdellastasin and an unidentified thrombininhibitor (Table <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">1</a>). In addition, our searches found robust hits against 23 other anticoagulant-related proteins from non-leech taxa. Several of the sequences possessed signal peptide regions at the 5’-end, indicating their secretion from the unicellular salivary glands. Although BLAST-based orthology statements have been commonplace in leech anticoagulant studies for almost a decade, without complementary phylogenetic analyses of putative orthologues, the robustness of such statements can be questioned<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">20</a>. Following the phylogenetic analyses presented here, it seems likely that 15 of the 16 leech-derived proteins (note that neither lefaxin nor the unidentified thrombin inhibitor was placed in a phylogenetic context due to the uncertainty of their identity and, therefore, comparative data) are indeed orthologous with their top BLAST hits, and the same number for non-leech proteins was 17 out of 23. A large body of literature supports the notion that phylogenetic analyses are needed for accurate orthology and paralogy statements (e.g.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">43</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">44</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">45</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">46</a>). Given that accurate orthology statements were only made possible via phylogenetic analyses, the present study underscores the importance of incorporating such analyses into any study where orthology is not determined a priori. However, the lack of appropriate outgroups for leech anticoagulants presents its own set of issues and certainly exacerbates rapid and accurate orthology determination. In this study, we assumed that H. medicinalis-derived proteins that formed a clan (equivalent to a monophyletic group in rooted phylogenies) with its archetypal variant (a protein with demonstrated anticoagulant capabilities) was indeed orthologous to that anticoagulant. The levels of potency in preventing blood clotting for each of our newly sequenced proteins remains to be investigated.</p><p id="d7a04999-5a26-4832-b67e-9bc918d8bcab" class="">When comparing the list of anticoagulants found in H. verbana<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">6</a> to that of the closely related H. medicinalis, surprisingly, only bdellin, piguamerin, antistasin, ghilanten, eglin C, manillase and C-type lectin overlap between the two species. The study by Kvist et al.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">6</a> recovered also hirustasin, therostasin and a leukocyte elastase inhibitor, as well as an unnamed plasmin inhibitor. By contrast, that study did not recover hirudin, destabilase I, LDTI, guamerin, bdellastasin, cystatin, ficolin, Kazal-type serpins or the unnamed thrombin inhibitor that were all recovered from Hirudo medicinalis. Surely, part of this discrepancy should be attributed to differing sequencing platforms, sequencing depth and imperfect search algorithms but, nevertheless, the data generated here allow for the first comparison between anticoagulants of closely related species of medicinal leeches. At the very least, this sets the stage for in-depth sequencing of the Hirudo verbana salivary transcriptome. It should be noted that neither study managed to recover matches against leech antiplatelet proteins (LAPP/saratin), which are commonly encountered in other leech species (see<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">2</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">3</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">6</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">16</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">18</a>,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">20</a>).

With the finding of presumably orthologous loci across the leech phylogeny – including antistasin family proteins, manillase and C-type lectin, for example – there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that these are present due to their possession by the common ancestor of all leeches. The present study adds to this and strengthens the case that the ancestral leech was indeed bloodfeeding, or at least possessed proteins that antagonize a normal coagulation cascade.</p><p id="82f3deb1-bdfb-4d1d-99d0-a1cfca09d6a6" class="">Moreover, whereas H. medicinalis is commonly employed in modern hospital settings to relieve venous congestion, the repertoire of secreted proteins that get injected into the patients has not before been fully known. The presence of hirudin is likely the factor that has afforded H. medicinalis its place in both historical and modern medical practices. The present study suggests that the potency of H. medicinalis saliva in counteracting the clotting cascade of blood is highly dependent on a larger cocktail of proteins that have several different targets in the cascade.</p><p id="bb1b1dd6-aca2-49fb-9037-7681e398ae76" class="">Whereas the present study focused on anticoagulant diversity and evolution, the creation of a draft genome holds the potential to ignite and inspire comparative studies of leech genomics.

If not identified, Phobius ver. 1.01<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">55</a> was used as an alternative identifier of a potential signal peptide.</p><p id="670651b9-f829-404e-a553-693a6469294a" class="">The copy numbers across the genome for each of the hits against well-characterized, leech-derived anticoagulants were estimated by BLASTing the top hit for each protein against the genome. Hits below the cutoff value of 1E−5, with a query length of at least 50% of the target and with at least 70% sequence similarity were considered good hits and, therefore, a copy of the query sequence. Because several of the targeted anticoagulation factors share similar amino acid compositions, each of the hits were compared the remaining pool to ensure that hits were not counted twice as separate anticoagulation factors. As an initial check of the positioning of the anticoagulants across the genome, we also assessed whether or not hits are adjacent to each other on the same scaffold.</p><h3 id="8938f810-4be0-45cb-8a93-0dffc579e74f" class="">Alignments and gene trees</h3><p id="4cc485a6-78d0-4e3c-a85f-f8e692640b3d" class="">Following the initial BLAST-based homology determination, orthology was determined by sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses. For each of the hits against well-characterized leech-derived anticoagulant proteins, the top hit was aligned with the amino acid sequence of the known (archetypal) anticoagulant. This was done both to visualize the level of conservation between the sequences and identify any insertions and/or deletions. For this purpose, the two sequences were aligned using the online version of MAFFT ver. 7<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">56</a> using default settings under the “Auto” strategy. JalView ver. 2<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">57</a> was used to visualize the alignments. To maximize regions of homology and to augment visualization of the alignments, leading and lagging gaps were truncated from the alignments, but internal gaps in the sequences (i.e., true indels) were maintained. Note that, in some cases, this resulted in the signal peptide region being excised from the sequences (these are still reported in Table <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">1</a>). From the alignments, percent amino acid conservation, with special emphasis on the conservation of disulphide-bond forming cysteines, was calculated by eye.</p><p id="83b6f490-87b4-47b9-b189-000c7383db1e" class="">Phylogenetic analyses were used to test for corroboration of the BLAST-based orthology determinations. Datasets for each of the hits against well-characterized anticoagulant proteins were constructed using the top BLASTp hit for the protein in our newly acquired dataset, amended by comparative data from the datasets used by Iwama et al.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">20</a> and Khan et al.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">58</a> for each protein. Sequences were again aligned using MAFFT ver. 7 with the same settings as above. The alignments were then subjected to maximum likelihood analyses using RAxML ver. 8.2.12<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">59</a> on the CIPRES Science Gateway Platform<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66749-5">60</a>. The searches were conducted under a general time reversible model (GTR) and rate heterogeneity was modelled by a gamma distribution using 25 rate categories and an estimated proportion of invariable sites. Support values for nodes were estimated through 1,000 standard bootstrap replicates using default settings. Given the paucity of obvious choices for outgroups for leech anticoagulants, the trees were left unrooted. All alignments, tree files and annotation files have been deposited in Zenodo (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3555585">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3555585</a>) (last accessed April 6th 2020).</p><h2 id="0e7abe89-3659-4fc2-a44c-c7615e953ace" class="">References</h2><ol type="1" id="078b60b3-d998-425c-ac8b-0d407ef309b7" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Babenko, V.
